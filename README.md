# 4-Bit-Processor-Logic-Design
## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation of a 4-bit processor logic unit. The project aims to demonstrate the fundamental principles of digital logic design, arithmetic operations, and control flow within a processor architecture.

## Features
- **4-Bit Architecture:** Utilizes a 4-bit data path for efficient representation of binary values.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, and logical operations.
- **Control Unit:** Includes a control unit for managing instruction execution and overall processor control flow.
- **Registers and Memory:** Incorporates registers for temporary data storage and explores memory interaction within a simplified architecture.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Provides simulation tools and testbenches to validate the functionality of the processor logic design.
